# FinTech LLM System Architecture

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive, high-frequency, AI-powered, risk-aware FinTech system designed to revolutionize financial decision-making, trading, and compliance. The system leverages cutting-edge technologies, including multi-agent LLM orchestration, real-time market monitoring, automated trading, blockchain compliance, and advanced fraud detection. The goal is to create a highly resilient, scalable, and regulatory-compliant system that can handle the complexities of modern financial markets.

## Key Features

1. Multi-Agent LLM Orchestration: Utilizes multiple LLM models (Bloom, GPT-4-Turbo, LLaMA, Mixtral, Falcon) for tasks such as market sentiment analysis, financial report summarization, fraud detection, and personalized financial recommendations.

2. Real-Time Market Monitoring & Risk Prediction: Implements real-time data ingestion pipelines for stock, crypto, and forex data, along with financial news scraping and regulatory filings ingestion.

3. Automated AI Trading Engine: Develops a fully autonomous trading system using reinforcement learning, backtesting strategies, and multi-asset trading support.

4. Blockchain Compliance & Security: Ensures regulatory compliance and security through blockchain-based audit logs and zero-knowledge proofs.

5. Advanced Fraud Detection: Implements graph-based anomaly detection for identifying insider trading, pump & dump schemes, and suspicious transactions.

6. Full-Stack FinTech UI: Provides an interactive trading and risk dashboard with real-time updates, AI-powered news sentiment heatmaps, and high-frequency trade execution.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories, each focusing on a specific aspect of the system:
